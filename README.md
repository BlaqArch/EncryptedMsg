# EncryptedMsg


This is a encrypter and decrypter for your messages or you can say important text you don't want others to see.
Also this is my first GitHub 'Completed' project.

How to use:
1) First Create a password.
2) Choose wether you want to encrypt or decrypt. (Ofcourse you should choose encrypt if none of your file is encrypted or it will give an error.)
3) If you want to see the encrypted message, just re-run the script and then select decrypt.
4) Enter your password, and you can see your encrypted message.
